# Canadian Computing Competition

My solutions, or attempts at solutions, to CCC problems!

Unlike my solutions to Advent of Code, here I only follow good coding practice if it helps me understand my thought process, since I try to do these under a timer ... so for the easier problems, it can be a free-for-all of single-letter variables, nested ternaries & comprehensions, and other shenanigans :P

(Might clean those commented-out code Soon™️, though.)
